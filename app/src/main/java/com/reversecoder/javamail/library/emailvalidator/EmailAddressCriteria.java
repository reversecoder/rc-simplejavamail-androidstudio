/**
 * Defines a set of restriction flags for email address validation. To remain completely true to RFC 2822, all flags should be set to <code>true</code>.
 * <p>
 * There are a few basic use cases:
 * <ol>
 *    	 <li>
 *    	     User wants to scrape as much data from a possibly-ugly address as they can and make a sensible address from it; these users typically allow all
 *    	     kinds of addresses (except perhaps for single-domain addresses) because in the wild, legitimate senders often violate 2822. E.g. If your goal is to
 *    	     parse spammy emails for analysis, you may want to allow every variation out there just so you can parse something useful.
 * 		</li>
 *     	<li>
 *     	    User wants to check to see if an email address is of proper, normal syntax; e.g. checking the value entered in a form. These users typically make
 * 			everything strict, since what most people consider a "valid" email address is a drastic subset of 2822. For users with the strictest requirements,
 * 			this library may not be enough, since although it checks most of RFC 2822, it might still be too 'tolerant' for their needs (on the other side of
 * 			the spectrum, most libraries use a simple blah@blah.blah.com type regex, which as we of course know is
 * 			<a href="http://www.troyhunt.com/2013/11/dont-trust-net-web-forms-email-regex.html">rarely a good idea</a>)
 * 		</li>
 * 		<li>
 * 		    User wants to intelligently parse a possibly-ugly address with the goal being a cleaned up usable address that other software
 * 		    (MTAs, databases, whatever) can use / parse without breaking; {@link #DEFAULT} tailors to this use case (with the possible exception of
 * 		    {@link #ALLOW_DOT_IN_A_TEXT}, to taste). In our experience they allowed "real" addresses the highest percentage of the time, and the addresses they
 * 		    failed on were almost all ridiculous.
 * 		</li>
 * </ol>
